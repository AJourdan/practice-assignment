# Practice Assignment

### Introduction

Welcome! Before we get started, let's do a small project that will reflect the kind of work we 
will be doing in the future.  CYR currently uses angular on the frontend, so this will also help
you learn angular and associated web technologies we use.  I will try to help you out when you are
in need.  So all'n'all, I hope this will be an good learning experience.

TL;DR The purpose of this project is to:

1. Help us familiarize eachothers workflow.
2. Provide a primer on Angular and CYR's API backend.
3. Act as a way to determine how to split future work.

### General Workflow
You will work with this repository by looking at existing tasks on the task board and 
implement them.  When done, submit it as a pull request.  I will look over the submission, provide
feedback, and merge your request once all the issues are resolved.  This is pretty much how it will 
work in the future, as we get more people on board.
